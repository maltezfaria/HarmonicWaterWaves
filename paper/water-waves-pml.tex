\begin{abstract}  
  We present a novel boundary integral equation (BIE) formulation for
  time-harmonic water-waves problem based on the complexification of Laplace's
  free-space Green function. The method employs a perfectly matched layer (PML)
  coordinate-stretching to render the propagative waves exponentially decaying,
  thus facilitating the truncation of the unbounded interfaces comprised by the
  free-surface and the bottom topography. The formulation uses only simple
  function evaluations (e.g. complex logarithms and square roots), avoiding the
  use of the water-wave Greenâ€™s function. We show through a variety of numerical
  examples that the truncation errors are exponentially small with respect to a
  parameter $\ell$ controlling the length of the PML layer.

\section{Introduction}

Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on unbounded domains poses
additional challenges from both a theoretical and numerical point of view.
Theoretically, one is required to impose appropriate conditions at infinity to
guarantee uniqueness of solutions; when the underlying PDE comes from the
modeling of the physical world, additional care must be taken to also ensure the
recovered (unique) solution is the ``physically relevant'' one. The numerical
challenges, on the other hand, stem from the fact that the discretization scheme
should incorporate information about the boundary conditions at infinity, also
called radiation condition; this can be done directly, by e.g. expanding the
solution in a basis which satisfy the radiation condition, or indirectly by
truncating the domain to a finite size and imposing instead a carefully chosen
boundary condition on the artificial boundaries of the truncated domain.

In the case of volume discretization methods such as finite difference and
finite elements, a particular class of truncation techniques which enjoys great
popularity due to its accuracy and simplicity is the Perfectly Matched Layers
(PMLs) method. Loosely speaking, the method consists of solving for the analytic
extension of the sought solution which decays exponentially at infinity. The
decay rate of the analytic extension then facilitates the truncation of the
domain upon discretization. On the physical (i.e. real) domain, PMLs can be
reinterpreted as surrounding the computational region by a material layer, not
necessarily physical, which absorbs but does not reflect incoming waves. A key
difference between PMLs and \emph{ad hoc} absorbing material methods stem from
the fact that the PML absorbing material is ``perfect'' in the sense that it is
reflectionless at the continuous level (i.e. before discretization).

An alternative to volume discretization methods are boundary integral equation
methods, which rely on the use of a Green function to recast the PDE in terms of
integral operators over the interfaces where the medium changes property. For
piece-wise homogeneous media, this reduces the PDE to integral equations posed
at the interface between the different media. Because boundary integral methods
represent the solution as a sum of fundamental solutions which satisfy the
radiation boundary condition, no domain truncation technique is required when
the interfaces are bounded. This is a well-known advantage of boundary integral
methods for scattering problems. There are interesting cases, however, where
such interfaces are better modeled as infinite. Examples include the scattering
of an object near the ground, the propagation of elastic waves under the surface
of the earth, wave-guides, and the water-waves problem described below. In such
cases a truncation technique is required, at least in the direction parallel to
the infinite interfaces, to reduce the problem to a finite subdomain where the
equations can be discretized.

In order to handle infinite interfaces in a boundary integral equation context,
a few options are available. For relatively simple geometries and boundary
conditions, one can construct a problem specific Greens function which
incorporates the boundary condition on all but a bounded portion of the
interface, thus reducing the problem again to integrals over bounded
curves/surfaces. This has the advantage of being conceptually simple provided
such problem-specific Greens function can be efficiently computed.
Unfortunately, for all but the simplest geometries, the representation of the
problem specific Greens function involves challenging integrals which must be
approximated numerically. Alternatives which rely instead on the use of the
free-space Greens function, readily available for many PDEs of physical
relevance, have also been developed. In \cite{perez2017windowed} a high-order
method called the Windowed-Green function (WGF) was introduced in order to
truncate the integrals stemming from the boundary integral representation of the
unbounded interfaces in the context of two- and three-dimensional
Helmholtz/Maxwell scattering problems. At a similar time, \cite{lu2018perfectly}
proposed a technique based on combining perfectly matched layers and a boundary
integral representation on a certain truncated domain in the context of
two-dimensional Helmholtz scattering problems. 
% Due to the exponential decay of the Helmholtz Green function on the
% complex-scaled PML layer, the kernels of the integral operators over the
% infinite interfaces become exponentially small, allowing for an efficient
% truncation with errors that decay exponentially respect to a truncation
% parameter $\ell$ controlling the PML length. 
It is worth mentioning the naive approach of simply truncating the domain far
enough from the region of interest is rather unsatisfactory, specially for
non-dissipative PDEs, due to the slow (algebraic) decay of the Greens function;
in fact, as we will argue in this paper, such an abrupt truncation may not even
converge in the zero-frequency regime, wherein the free-space Green function is
no longer decaying.

In this paper we build on the work of~\cite{lu2018perfectly} to develop a
complex-scaled boundary integral equation method for the classical harmonic
water-waves problem. The water-waves problem presents some interesting and novel
challenges, of both theoretical and numerical nature, which are related to the
fact that the free-space Green function is non-oscillatory, and as such its
analytic extension does not become exponentially small inside the PML region
(this contrasts the work in~\cite{lu2018perfectly}, where the exponential decay
of the Helmholtz free-space Green's function facilitates the analysis). Despite
the non-oscillatory behavior of the Laplace fundamental solution, which in fact
grows logarithmically at infinity in two-dimensions, we will argue that the
solution can be analytically extended into the complex plane to become
exponentially decreasing, justifying at least formally the truncation of certain
integrals over unbounded domains. 

In more detail, letting $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ denote the (unbounded)
fluid domain bounded above by the linearized free surface $\Gamma_f$ and below
by a bottom topography $\Gamma_b$, and letting $\Omega_o \subset \mathbb{R}^2$
denote solid obstacles (either fully or partially) immersed in the fluid with
$\Gamma_o = \partial \Omega_o$, we seek to solve the following system of equations:
%
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:water-waves-system}
  \begin{align}  
    \label{eq:laplace-equation}
    \Delta \varphi &=0, \quad \bx \in \Omega,\\
    \label{eq:free-surface-bc}
    \nabla \varphi \cdot \bn + \frac{\omega^2}{g}\varphi &=f_1, \quad \bx \in \Gamma_f,\\
    \label{eq:solid-bc}  
    \nabla \varphi \cdot \bn &=f_2, \quad \bx \in \Gamma_s \cup \Gamma_o,\\
    \label{eq:radiation-condition}  
    \lim_{|x_1| \to \infty} \partial_{|x_1|} \varphi - i k \varphi  &= 0
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
where $k \in \mathbb{R}^+$ in~\cref{eq:radiation-condition} is the solution
of $k\tanh(kd) = \omega^2/g$, with $\omega$ being a given frequency and $g$ is
the gravitational acceleration. The variable $\varphi$ is a velocity potential
related to the fluid velocity $\boldsymbol{u}$ through $\boldsymbol{u}(\bx,t) =
e^{-i\omega t} \nabla \varphi$.  Throughout this paper $\bx = (x_1,x_2) \in \R^2$
denotes a target point, and $\bn$ is the unit normal pointing towards the fluid
domain $\Omega$. Furthermore, the free surface is always located at $x_2 = 0$,
so that $\Gamma_f = \R \times \{0\} \setminus \Omega_o$, and the topography is
of constant depth $d$ outside a bounded domain (i.e. $\Gamma_b \setminus \R
\times \{-d\}$ is bounded). Finally, for notational simplicity, it will be
convenient to define $\Gamma = \Gamma_f \cup \Gamma_s \cup \Gamma_o$, together
with a global impedance-like coefficient $\alpha(\bx)$, and global source term $f$ so
that the boundary conditions~\cref{eq:free-surface-bc,eq:solid-bc} become simply
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:global-bc}  
  \nabla \varphi \cdot \bn + \alpha(\bx) \varphi = f, \quad \bx \in \Gamma,
\end{align}
%
with
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:global-defs}  
  \alpha(\bx) = \begin{cases}
    \omega^2/g  &\bx \in \Gamma_f\\
    0   &\bx \in \Gamma_b \cup \Gamma_o
  \end{cases}, \quad
  f(\bx) = \begin{cases}
    f_1  &\bx \in \Gamma_f,\\
    f_2  &\bx \in \Gamma_b \cup \Gamma_o,
  \end{cases}, 
\end{align}
% 

The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. In
\cref{sec:problem-formulation} we present the problem under consideration, and
introduce the transformed problem under the PML change-of-variables. We focus in
particular on the non-orthogonal PMLs, and show ...

\section{Complex scaled integral equation}

In this section we derive the main result of this paper: a complex scaled
integral equation for solving~\cref{eq:water-waves-system} with the desirable
property that its solutions are exponentially decreasing as $x_1 \to \pm
\infty$. To this end, we begin by recalling some classical results about the
modal decomposition of $\phi$ for a channel of constant (finite) depth. 

Suppose that problem \cref{eq:water-waves-system} is well-posed. Since the
source term $f$ and the perturbation of the domain $\Omega_h$ are all supported
in $|x_1|<L$,  the solution $\varphi$ satisfies homogeneous equations in
$|x_1|>L$. As a consequence, it can be represented in $|x_1|>L$ as a
superposition of modal solutions,  which are solutions of the equations with
separated variables. More precisely (see for instance \cite{Bon-Jol-1993}), let
us introduce the sequence $(\gamma_n)_{n\geq 1}$ such that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:disp-evanescent}
\gamma_n\tan(\gamma_nh)=-\dfrac{\omega^2}{g},\quad n\pi-\frac{\pi}{2}<\gamma_n h<n\pi+\frac{\pi}{2}
    \end{equation}
    and recall that $k\tanh(kh)=\omega^2/g$. Then one can prove that, with a suitable choice of the normalization constants $(a_n)$, the functions $(u_n)_{n\geq 0}$ form a Hilbert basis of $L^2((-h,0))$, where
    \begin{align}
    \label{eq:transversemodes}
    u_0(x_2)=a_0\cosh(k(x_2+h)),&\\
    u_n(x_2)=a_n\cos(\gamma_n(x_2+h)),& \quad n\geq 1.
  \end{align}
This, together with the radiation condition \cref{eq:radiation-condition}, leads
to the following modal decomposition of $\varphi$:
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:modaldecomp}
  \varphi(x_1,x_2) = \begin{cases}
  A_0^+u_0(x_2)e^{ik(x_1-L)} + \sum_{n\geq 1}A_n^+u_n(x_2)e^{-\gamma_n(x_1-L)} &\mbox{for }x_1>L,\\
  A_0^-u_0(x_2)e^{-ik(x_1+L)} +\sum_{n\geq 1}A_n^-u_n(x_2)e^{\gamma_n(x_1+L)} &\mbox{for }x_1<-L.
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
  A_n^\pm=\int_{-h}^0\varphi(\pm L,x_2)\overline{u_n(x_2)}dx_2,\quad n\geq 0.  
\end{align}

We see that, on each side of the perturbation,  the potential $\varphi$ is a
superposition of the outgoing surface wave and of infinitely many evanescent
modes. These expansions converge uniformly in $|x_1|>L$, together with all their
derivatives. This shows in particular that $\varphi$ is a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$
function in $|x_1|>L$, up to the boundaries $x_2=0$ and $x_2=L$. More
importantly for our purpose, this modal decomposition can be used to study
analytic properties of $\varphi$ with respect to the coordinate $x_1$. 
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:analyticity}
  Suppose that problem \cref{eq:water-waves-system} is well-posed. Then its solution $\varphi$ for $x_1>L$ (resp. $x_1<-L$)  has an analytic extension to complex values of $x_1$ in $\Re(x_1)>L$ (resp. $\Re(x_1)<-L$). 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let us consider for instance the side $x_1>L$. 
  It is clear that for any $N \geq 1$, the finite sum $$A_0^-u_0(x_2)e^{-ik(x_1+L)}+\sum_{n= 1}^NA_n^-u_n(x_2)e^{\gamma_n(x_1+L)}$$
is well-defined for complex values of $x_1$, and is a holomorphic function of $x_1$. Moreover, it converges to $\varphi(x_1,x_2)$ when $N\to +\infty$, uniformly in all compact subsets of $\Re(x_1)>L$.  Finally, thanks to Morera theorem, a uniform limit of a sequence of holomorphic functions is itself holomorphic.
\end{proof}

In the sequel, we are interested in the analytic extension of $\varphi$ when it
is exponentially decaying at infinity. This leads to consider the analytic
extension of $\varphi$ for $\Re(x_1)>L$  (resp. $\Re(x_1)<-L$) only for
$\Im(x_1)>0$ (resp. $\Im(x_1)<0$), so that the propagating surface mode becomes
exponentially decaying at infinity. This motivates the introduction of
complex-stretching change of variables $\tau : \R^2 \to \C$ whose main goal is
to transform the water waves problem ~\cref{eq:water-waves-system} so that its
(radiative) solutions become exponentially decaying functions. 

Let $\tilde{x}_1 = \tau(\bx)$, with $\tau(\bx) = x_1$ for $|x_1| < L$. Then the
analytic extension of $\varphi$ satisfies, 
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:complex-equations}  
  \begin{align}  
      \label{eq:pml-laplace-equation}
      \Delta_{\tilde{\bx}} \varphi &=0, \quad \bx \in \Omega,\\
      \label{eq:pml-bc1} 
      \nabla_{\tilde{\bx}} \varphi \cdot \bn + \alpha(\bx) \varphi &=0, \quad \bx \in \Gamma_{f},\\
      \label{eq:pml-bc2} 
      \nabla_{\tilde{\bx}} \varphi \cdot \bn &=  f,  \quad \bx \in \Gamma_{s},
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\Delta_{\tilde{\bx}} = \partial_{\tilde{x}_1 \tilde{x}_1} + \partial_{x_2
x_2}$ and $\nabla_{\tilde{\bx}} = \left[\partial_{\tilde{x}_1},\partial_{x_2}
\right]^\top$ are the Laplacian and gradient respect to the complex variable
$\tilde{x}_1$. Letting $\tvarphi(x_1,x_2) = \varphi(\tilde{x}_1,x_2) =
\varphi(\tau(\bx),x_2)$, application of the chain rule, together with some
algebraic manipulations, allows us to transform \cref{eq:complex-equations} back
to the real derivatives, yielding the following modified water waves problem for
$\tilde{\varphi}$:
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:pml-water-waves}  
  \begin{align}
      \label{eq:pml-laplace-real}
      \nabla \cdot \left( A \nabla \tvarphi(\bx) \right) &= 0, \quad \bx \in \Omega,\\
      \label{eq:pml-bc-real} 
      \nabla \tvarphi \cdot J^{-1}\bn - \alpha \tvarphi &= f \quad \bx \in \Gamma,
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $A = |J|J^{-1}(J^{-1})^\top \in \C^{2 \times 2}$, with $J$ given by
\begin{align}
  J =   
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \partial_{x_1} \tau & \partial_{x_2} \tau\\
    0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
System~\cref{eq:pml-water-waves} is the PML-transformed system of equations that
we next seek to solve in lieu of~\cref{eq:water-waves-system} by a boundary
integral equation method.

In what follows, we apply the general theory of boundary integral equations for
strongly elliptic systems~\cite{mclean2000strongly}. This imposes restrictions
on $\tau$ so that the system \cref{eq:pml-laplace-real} is strongly elliptic, as
per the following definition~\cite[equation 4.7]{mclean2000strongly}:
\begin{definition}[Strongly elliptic PDE]
  The scalar partial differential equation
  \begin{align}
    \nabla \cdot \left( A(\bx) \nabla \tvarphi(\bx) \right) = 0,
  \end{align}
  where $A$ is a symmetric $2 \times 2$ matrix over $\mathbb{C}$ and
  $\tvarphi : \R^2 \to \C$, is strongly-elliptic on the domain $\Omega$
  if $\exists \delta > 0$ s.t.
  \begin{align}
    \mathrm{Re}\left( \xi^* A(\bx) \xi \right) > \delta |\xi|^2,
  \end{align}
  for all $\bx \in \Omega$, $\xi \in \C^{d}$, where $\xi^*$ denotes the complex
  transpose (adjoint) of $\xi$.
\end{definition}

The following proposition provides necessary and sufficient conditions under
which \cref{eq:pml-laplace-real} is strongly elliptic:
%
\begin{proposition}
  \label{pr:algebraic-condition-strongly-elliptic}
  The system \cref{eq:pml-laplace-real} is strongly elliptic if and only if
  $\mathrm{Re}(A)$ is positive definite.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Since $A$ was assumed symmetric, it follows that
  \begin{align}
  2 \mathrm{Re}(\xi^* A \xi) = \xi^* A \xi + \overline{\xi^* A \xi}= \xi^* A \xi + \xi^* \bar{A} \xi = 2 \xi^* \mathrm{Re}(A) \xi
  \end{align}
  Splitting $\xi = \xi_r + i\xi_i$ into its real and imaginary parts, with
  $\xi_r,\xi_i \in \R^d$, we have that
  \begin{align}
  \xi^* \mathrm{Re}(A) \xi = \xi_r^t \mathrm{Re}(A) \xi_r + \xi_i^t \mathrm{Re}(A) \xi_i
  \end{align}
  If $\mathrm{Re}(A)$ is positive definite, we have that $\exists \delta > 0$ s.t.
  \begin{align}
  \xi^* \mathrm{Re}(A) \xi > \delta (\xi_r^2 + \xi_i^2) = \delta |\xi|^2
  \end{align}
  which proves the result one way. If $\mathrm{Re}(A)$ is not positive definite,
  then $\exists v \in \R^2$ s.t. $v^t \mathrm{Re}(A) v \leq 0$. Letting $\xi = v$
  the other direction is proved.
\end{proof}
\Cref{pr:algebraic-condition-strongly-elliptic} provides an algebraic criterion,
dependent only on the chosen change of variable $\btau$, to determine whether
\cref{eq:pml-laplace-real} is strongly elliptic on $\Omega$. 

In what follows we consider $\tau(x_1,x_2) = \mu(x_1) + i \sigma(x_1,x_2)$,
where $\mu : \R \to \R$ represents a real-stretching and $\sigma : \R^2 \to \R$
is the complex-stretching. A straightforward calculation shows that 
\begin{align}
  A = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{1 + \tau_{,2}^2}{\tau_{,1}} & -\tau_{,2} \\
    -\tau_{,2} & \tau_{,1}
  \end{bmatrix}, \quad
  \mathrm{Re}(A) = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,2})^2 \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,1}) + 2 \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,2}) \mathrm{Im}(\tau_{,2}) \mathrm{Im}(\tau_{,1}) - \mathrm{Im}(\tau_{,2}) ^2 \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,1}) + \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,1})}{|\tau_{,1}|^2} & -\mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,2}) \\
    -\mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,2}) & \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,1})
  \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}


In most of what follows we will employ the so-called orthogonal PMLs whereas
$\tau = \tau(x_1)$; this yields a \emph{diagonal} Jacobian matrix $J$ (and thus
a diagonal $A$). Under this simplifying hypothesis, directly verifying that the
PML-tranformed PDE remains strongly elliptic is straightforward, for the matrix
$A$ takes the following simple form
\begin{align}
    A =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{1}{\tau'} & 0 \\
      0 & \tau'
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{align}
where $\tau' = \partial_{x_1} \tau$.
Using~\cref{pr:algebraic-condition-strongly-elliptic}, it immediately follows
that for orthogonal PMLs the system is strongly elliptic provided
$\mathrm{Re}(\tau') > 0$. 

The non-orthogonal case is a more involved, as it imposes constraints on the
derivatives of $\tau$ with respect to $x_2$. A straightforward calculation shows
that 
\begin{align}
  A = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{1 + \tau_{,2}^2}{\tau_{,1}} & -\tau_{,2} \\
    -\tau_{,2} & \tau_{,1}
  \end{bmatrix}, \quad
  \mathrm{Re}(A) = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,2})^2 \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,1}) + 2 \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,2}) \mathrm{Im}(\tau_{,2}) \mathrm{Im}(\tau_{,1}) - \mathrm{Im}(\tau_{,2}) ^2 \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,1}) + \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,1})}{|\tau_{,1}|^2} & -\mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,2}) \\
    -\mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,2}) & \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,1})
  \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}
To simplify the computations, we will suppose that $\tau(x_1,x_2) = \mu(x_1) + i \sigma(x_1,x_2)$, with both
$\mu$ and $\sigma$ real-valued functions. The matrix $\mathrm{Re}(A)$ then becomes
\begin{align}  
  \mathrm{Re}(A) = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\mu'(1-\sigma_{,2}^2)}{\mu'^2 + \sigma_{,1}^2} & 0 \\
    0 & \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{,1})
  \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}
Since $\mu' > 0$, ellipticity is equivalent to the condition $|\sigma_{,2}(x_1,x_2)| <
1 \ \forall \ (x_1,x_2)  \in \Omega$. We will return to this condition later
when considering non-orthogonal PMLs in order to provide a geometrical meaning
to this conditions.

Proceeding henceforth under the assumption $\tau$ is such
that~\cref{eq:pml-laplace-real} is strongly elliptic in the sense
of~\cref{pr:algebraic-condition-strongly-elliptic}, it follows from the general
theory of boundary integral equations~\cite{mclean2000strongly} that $\tvarphi$
admits Green-like integral representation formulae. Indeed, letting $\tilde{G}$
be the free-space Green's function associated with \cref{eq:pml-laplace-real},
and $\Omega_M = \left\{\bx \in \Omega : |x_1| <  M \right\}$ be a truncated
domain with $M>L$, the following integral representation formula holds:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:greens-representation}
  \tvarphi(\br) = \mathcal{D}_{\partial \Omega_M}[\gamma_0\tvarphi](\br) - \mathcal{S}_{\partial \Omega_M}[\tilde{\gamma}_1 {\tvarphi}](\br) \quad \mbox{for} \quad \br \in \Omega_M,
\end{align}
where $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ are the generalized Dirichlet and Neumann trace
operators, formally defined as 
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:traces}  
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:dir-trace}
  \gamma_0[\sigma](\bx) &= \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \sigma(\bx + \epsilon \bn(\bx)),\\
  \label{eq:neu-trace}
  \gamma_1[\sigma](\bx) &= \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \nabla \sigma(\bx + \epsilon \bn(\bx)) \cdot A^t \bn(\bx),
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
and $\mathcal{S}_{\partial \Omega_M}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{\partial \Omega_M}$ denote the single- and
double-layer potentials over $\partial \Omega_M$:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:potentials}
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:SL-potential}  
    \mathcal{S}_{\partial \Omega_M}[\sigma](\br) &:= \int_{\partial \Omega_M} {\tilde{G}}(\br, \by)\sigma(\by) \de s(\by), \\
    \label{eq:DL-potential}  
    \mathcal{D}_{\partial \Omega_M}[\sigma](\br) &:= \int_{\partial \Omega_M} \tilde{\gamma}_{1,\by}{\tilde{G}}(\br, \by) \sigma(\by) \de s(\by).
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
(The notation $\tilde{\gamma}_{1,\by}$ in~\eqref{eq:DL-potential} means the
derivatives in the operator $\tilde{\gamma}_1$ are with respect to the $\by$
variable). 

Using the fact that $\tvarphi$ decays exponentially as $|x_1| \to \infty $,
while the integral kernels in~\cref{eq:greens-representation} grow at most
logarithmically, the contribution from the lateral curves $\{ \pm M\} \times
[0,-h]$ are exponentially small and in the limit $M \to \infty$ we may replace
$\Omega_M$ (resp. $\partial \Omega_M$) by $\Omega$ (resp. $\partial \Omega =
\Gamma$) in~\cref{eq:greens-representation} (resp.~\cref{eq:potentials}). This
justifies the validity of the complex-scaled boundary integral representation on
the domain $\Omega$ containing the unbounded interface $\Gamma$. 

Finally, applying the trace operators $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$
to~\cref{eq:greens-representation}, and accounting for the jump in the
double-layer potential across $\Gamma$, we arrive at the well-known Green's
identity:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:greens-formula}
  \frac{\gamma_0 \tvarphi(\bx)}{2} &=  D[\gamma_0 \tvarphi](\bx) - S[{\gamma}_1 \tvarphi](\bx) \quad \mbox{for} \quad \bx \in \Gamma,
\end{align}
where $S$ and $D$ are the single- and double-layer operators,
defined as:
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:calderon-operators}
  \begin{align}
  \label{eq:SL-operator}  
  S[\varphi](\bx) &:= \int_\Gamma \tilde{G}(\bx,\by) \varphi(\by) \de s(\by)\\
  \label{eq:DL-operator}  
  D[\varphi](\bx) &:= {\rm p.v.}\! \int_\Gamma\left(\tilde{\gamma}_{1,\by}\tilde{G}(\bx,\by)\right)
  \varphi(\by) \de s(\by)
\end{align}\label{eq:BIOS}\end{subequations}
where p.v. in front of~\cref{eq:DL-operator} means the integral is to be
interpreted as a Cauchy principal-value.

Interestingly, owing to the fact~\cref{eq:pml-laplace-real} was obtained through
a change of variables of a constant coefficient PDE with known fundamental
solution, the free-space greens function $\tilde{G}(\bx,\by)$ is explicitly
given by $\tilde{G}(\bx,\by) = G(\tau(\bx),\tau(\by))$:
\begin{proposition}[PML Greens function]
  The free-space Greens function associated with~\cref{eq:pml-laplace-real} is
  given by
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:complex-Green-function}
  \tilde{G}(\bx,\by) = G_{\Delta}(\tau(\bx),\tau(\by)) = -\frac{1}{2\pi}\log(\rho(\btau(\bx),\btau(\by)))
  \end{align}
  where $\rho(\bx,\by) = \sqrt{(\bx-\by)\cdot(\bx-\by)}$, and where the square
  root is chosen with a branch-cut on the negative real line.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  For the sake of completeness, we present a formal proof
  in~\cref{sec:greens-function} which makes use only of elementary calculus; the
  reader is directed to \cite{kim2010analysis} for a rigorous treatment. 
\end{proof}

With the validity of the representation formula~\cref{eq:greens-representation}
established, and the Green's function readily available
in~\cref{eq:complex-Green-function}, we can now
reformulate~\cref{eq:pml-laplace-real} using a boundary integral equation. For
this purpose it is useful to recast the boundary condition~\cref{eq:pml-bc-real}
using the co-normal derivative of $\tvarphi$:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:pml-bc-real-2}
  \nabla \tvarphi \cdot A\bn + |J| \alpha \tvarphi &= f, \quad \bx \in \Gamma.
\end{align}
(In deriving~\cref{eq:pml-bc-real-2}, we simply multiplied~\cref{eq:pml-bc-real}
by $|J|$ and used the fact that $(J^{-1})^\top \bn =
\bn$). Using~\cref{eq:pml-bc-real-2} to replace $\gamma_1\tvarphi := \nabla
\tvarphi \cdot A \bn$ in favor of $\gamma_0 \tvarphi$
in~\cref{eq:greens-formula}, we obtain the following second-kind boundary
integral equation (BIE) for the unknown velocity potential $\tvarphi$:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:BIE}
  \frac{\tvarphi(\bx)}{2} - D[\tvarphi](\bx) + S\left[\alpha\left|J\right|\tvarphi\right](\bx) &= S[f](\bx), \quad \bx \in \Gamma.
\end{align}

Letting $\sigma = |J|\tvarphi$, it follows after some algebraic manipulations
that the boundary integral equation that we seek to solve is given by:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:BIE-final}  
  \frac{\sigma}{2|J|} - \int_\Gamma \frac{\partial G_{\Delta}}{\partial \bn_\by}(\tau(\bx),\tau(\by)) \sigma(\by) \de s(\by) + \frac{\omega^2}{g}\int_{\Gamma_f} G_{\Delta}(\tau(\bx),\tau(\by)) \sigma(\by) \de s(\by) \\
  = \int_{\Gamma} G_{\Delta}(\tau(\bx),\tau(\by)) f(\by) \de s(\by). \nonumber
\end{align}
where the $\Gamma_f$ subscript in the single-layer operator means that
integration is performed only over the free-surface. Interestingly, the proposed
complex-scaled formulation~\cref{eq:BIE-final} depends linearly on the frequency
$\omega$; this contrasts e.g. formulations based on the water-waves Green's
function, for which the $\omega$ dependency appears (non-linearly) inside the
kernels of the integral operators. We will explore this feature to compute
resonant frequencies in~\cref{sec:?} through a linear (generalized) eigenvalue
problem.

In the following section, we solve \cref{eq:BIE-final} by first truncating the
unbounded curves at some finite distance, and then by discretizing the
(singular) integral operators by an appropriate quadrature rule. 

\begin{remark}[Irregular frequencies]
  It remains unclear whether~\cref{eq:BIE-final} is uniquely solvable for all
  frequencies $\omega$. If there exists values of $\omega$ such that the
  homogenous system ($f=0$) admits a non-trivial solution, then there is no
  uniqueness of the BIE. The unboundedness of $\Gamma$, together with the fact
  that $|J|$ is not constant, however, makes it difficult to address this
  question.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Indirect formulation]
  Another approach to derive a boundary integral equation
  for~\cref{eq:water-waves-system} is to use an \emph{indirect} approach, where
  we seek the velocity potential in the form $\tilde{\phi}(\br) =
  \mathcal{S}[\sigma](\br)$, where $\sigma$ is an unknown density to be found by
  imposing the boundary conditions. This leads to an equation similar
  to~\cref{eq:BIE}; we have chosen to pursue a \emph{direct} formulation in
  order to exploit the fact that $\tvarphi$ is exponentially decreasing as
  $|\bx_\perp| \to \infty$. For the indirect formulation, that is likely to be
  true for the density $\sigma$, but we have not explored that option in great
  detail. 
\end{remark}

\section{Discretization}

In everything that follows, we take $\tau = x_1 + i $

Given the physical parameters $\omega, g$ and $h$, we compute $k$ and $\gamma_1$
by solving 

\subsection{PML}

Given the physical parameters

\section{Numerical results}

Unless otherwise state, we will always fix $\omega^2/g$ to be one, and take the
$\tau(x_1) = x_1 + i c (x-)$ In our first
example, we consider the semi-infinite domain $\R^+ \times [0,-h]$, and impose a
boundary condition on the $\Gamma_l = \{ 0 \} \times [0,-h]$ curve. The depth
$d$ is taken to be $1$, which yields $k \approx 1.2$ and $\gamma_1=2.8$. 

From the
modal decomposition~\cref{eq:modaldecomp}, we know that
\begin{align}
  \varphi(x_1,x_2) = A_0^+u_0(x_2)e^{ik(x_1)} + \sum_{n\geq 1}A_n^+u_n(x_2)e^{-\gamma_n(x_1)},
\end{align}
is an exact solution of our problem. Taking its trace on $\Gamma_l$, we have our
problem setup.

In the first test we take $A_0 = 1$, $A_n = 0$ for $n\geq 1$, so that the
solution is simply the propagative mode. The results are show in figure ...

\end{figure}

As the depth is increased, we observe a change in the convergence behavior:

  \begin{subfigure}{0.49\linewidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/convergence_pml_planewave_depth_3.pdf}

  \end{subfigure}
  \label{fig:convergence-modal-solution}
  \caption{Change in the convergence behavior as the depth $d$ is increased.}
\end{figure}

While not necessary, it is possible to further improve the convergence of the
method respect to the truncation parameter to obtain a $d$-independent result as
$d \to \infty$. To this end, it is necessary to modify $\tau$ so that it also
performs a real-stretching after the PML layer. We thus consider the change
of variables $\tau$
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:pml-with-stretching}  
  \mu = \begin{cases}
    x_1, & |x_1| < L + \ell \\
    \mu_0 (x_1 - L-\ell) + L+\ell, & |x_1| \geq L + \ell
  \end{cases}, \quad
  \sigma = \begin{cases}
    0, & |x_1| < L\\
    \sigma_0 (x_1 - L) + L, & |x_1| \geq L
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
%
A visualization of this change of variables is given
in~\cref{fig:pml-with-stretching}.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/pml_real_and_imag.pdf}

  and $\mu_0 = 2$.}

\end{figure}
%

With the real stretching, we can recover the expected convergence rate
of~\cref{fig:convergence-modal-solution-depth-4}

% \section{Ellipticity condition}

% For the two-dimensional problem, we have that 
% \begin{align}
%   J = \begin{bmatrix}
%     \tau_{1,1} & \tau_{1,2}\\
%     0 & 1
%   \end{bmatrix}
%   ,\quad 
%   J^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
%     1/\tau_{1,1} & -\tau_{1,2}/\tau_{1,1}\\
%     0 & 1
%   \end{bmatrix}
% \end{align}
% and so
% \begin{align}
%   A = |J|J^{-1}(J^{-1})^t = 
%   \frac{1}{\tau_{1,1}}
%   \begin{bmatrix}
%     1 + \tau_{1,2}^2 & -\tau_{1,2}\tau_{1,1} \\
%     -\tau_{1,2}\tau_{1,1} & \tau_{1,1}^2
%   \end{bmatrix}
% \end{align}
% Assuming $\tau_{1,2}$ is purely imaginary, we have that
% \begin{align}
%   \mathrm{Re}(A) = 
%   \begin{bmatrix}
%     \mathrm{Re}\left(\frac{1 + \tau_{1,2}^2}{\tau_{1,1}}\right) & 0 \\
%     0 & \mathrm{Re}(\tau_{1,1})
%   \end{bmatrix}
% \end{align}
% Considering a change of variables of the form $\tau_i = x_i + i\sigma_i(\bx)$,
% we arrive at the following simple condition:
% \begin{align}
%   |\sigma_{1,2}| < 1
% \end{align}


% While in \cref{sec:orthogonal-pml} we considered the special case where
% $\tau(\bx) = (\tau_1(x_1),\tau_2(x_2))$, we present now the generic case with
% $\tau(\bx) = (\tau_1(\bx),\tau_2(\bx))$. The matrix $A$ is then given by
% \begin{align}
%   A = \frac{1}{|J|}
%   \begin{bmatrix}
%     \tau_{2,2}^2 + \tau_{1,2}^2 & -\tau_{2,1}\tau_{2,2} - \tau_{1,2}\tau_{1,1} \\
%     -\tau_{2,1}\tau_{2,2} - \tau_{1,2}\tau_{1,1}  & \tau_{1,1}^2 + \tau_{2,1}^2
%   \end{bmatrix},
% \end{align}

% Determining ellipticity of this matrix (i.e. finding conditions on $\tau$ under
% which $\mathrm{Re}(A)$ is positive definite) in the general case is a somewhat
% cumbersome calculation which we deferred to \cref{sec:ellipticity-of-A}. For the
% numerical examples we consider in \cref{sec:numerical-examples}, it suffices to
% focus on the uni-axial (but non-orthogonal) case, where we assume $\tau_2(\bx) =
% x_2$. The matrix $A$ then simplifies to
% \begin{align}
%   A  =   \begin{bmatrix}
%     \frac{1 - \sigma_{1,2}^2}{1 + i\sigma_{1,1}} & -i\sigma_{1,2} \\
%     -i\sigma_{1,2} & 1 + i\sigma_{1,1}
%   \end{bmatrix}, \quad
%                      \mathrm{Re}(A) =   \begin{bmatrix}
%     \frac{1 - \sigma_{1,2}^2}{1+\sigma_{1,1}^2} & 0 \\
%     0 & 1
%   \end{bmatrix},
% \end{align}
% %
% and strong ellipticity is equivalent to the simple condition:
% \begin{align}
%   \label{eq:ellipticity-condition-nonorthogonal}
%   \left| \sigma_{1,2}(\bx) \right| < 1 \quad \mbox{for all} \quad \bx \in \Omega.
% \end{align}

% In order to give a geometric interpretation to this condition, it is useful to
% consider a simple case given by
% \begin{align}
%   \tau_1 =
%   \begin{cases}
%     x_1 + i \beta (x_1 + \frac{1}{\alpha} x_2 + a) \quad &\mbox{for} \quad x_1 < -\frac{1}{\alpha} x_2 - a, \\
%     x_1 \quad &\mbox{for} \quad |x_1| < \frac{1}{\alpha} x_2 + a, \\
%     x_1 + i \beta (x_1 - \frac{1}{\alpha} x_2 - a) \quad &\mbox{for} \quad x_1 > \frac{1}{\alpha} x_2 + a.
%   \end{cases}
% \end{align}
% The parameters $\alpha$ and $a$ determine the region where the PML is applied,
% and the parameter $\beta$ controls the attenuation strength inside the PML layer
% (see \cref{fig:sch-pml}). By taking taking the limit $\alpha \to \infty$, for
% instance, we recover the case of an orthogonal PML discussed in
% \cref{sec:orthogonal-pml}.

% We are interested in the analytic extension of $\varphi$ when it is
% exponentially decaying at infinity. This leads to consider the analytic
% extension of $\varphi$ for $\Re(x_1)>L$  (resp. $\Re(x_1)<-L$) only for
% $\Im(x_1)>0$ (resp. $\Im(x_1)<0$), so that the propagating surface mode becomes
% exponentially decaying at infinity. Letting $\btau : \R^2 \to
% \C^2$ mapping points $\bx$ on the physical domain to $\tilde{\bx} = \btau(\bx)$.
% Then, assuming that $\tau(\bx)$ is the identity map for $|x_1|<L$, and defining
% $\tilde{\varphi}(x_1,x_2) = \varphi(\tau(x_1),x_2)$ as the analytic
